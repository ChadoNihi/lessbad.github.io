# About

The intended core thread of this blog is [abolition](https://www.abolitionist.com/) of [severe suffering](https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/) for all sentient beings. Key topics include [suffering-focused ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering-focused_ethics), [anti-speciesism](https://www.animal-ethics.org/speciesism/), [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), [wild-animal suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering), [transhumanism](https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/superwell.html), [consciousness](https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/glossary) (including exotic states thereof), and announcement and updates on concrete [projects](https://suffering-abolition.github.io/intervention-mindmap-against-suffering/).

The goal is to facilitate discussion and idea sharing in abolitionist and broader effective altruism communities _so that_ in the end we pursue more effective projects towards suffering abolition. At the same time, some posts can be more introductory, aiming at wider audiences.

In these early[^release] days of the blog, Nil is the sole author of the blog. However, anyone is invited to [propose their text](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/EXzsGzPZtxqY53YGk8cKhjwSaAQpbLh6I8MoCj7vkA8/) to be published on the blog.

[^release]: The blog went online [on Sep 22, 2021](https://gitlab.com/lessbad/lessbad.gitlab.io/-/commit/8e0ebf4982ed01a3b4f39b32a77fdf4d27ff61ac). (The [first post](https://lessbad.gitlab.io/posts/classical-utilitarianism-concerns/) has an earlier publication date because it is actually a [repost](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MhsJgYRarrtGdTv8S/some-concerns-with-classical-utilitarianism) from the EA Forum.)
