## Read this first

This blog post is about the MDMA experience, not about how one could induce it. The reality, of course, is that taking MDMA is the only consistent way of inducing the experience.[^rc]

[^rc]: There are also relatively novel “research chemicals” like [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) and [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB), which were intended to mimic the MDMA experience. Reports vary on whether any of such “alternatives” deliver the wholeness of the MDMA experience - the clarity, empathetic outwardness, inner peacefulness / removal of suffering; energy, etc. FWIW I remain skeptical that there is a substitute for MDMA for reliably inducing the experience. My skepticism is mostly based on what I’ve read so far, including that 1) what is sold on the street as “ecstasy” often isn't pure MDMA (see below in the section) and that 2) people invent drug combos (e.g. [variations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borax/comments/tufa3t/is_there_an_updated_version_of_the_mix/) of “Borax” combo) attempting to replicate the full spectrum of the MDMA experience (NB: do not combine drugs unless you know what you’re doing! see below in the section). Most importantly perhaps, none of the proposed alternatives has been nearly as well researched health wise as has been MDMA (even though the fact that in some parts of the world one still can buy some of such “alternatives” legally (as “not-for-human-consumption” “research chemicals”) does IMO give them points for being relatively safe in terms of the risk of imprisonment (for consequences of imprisonment may be the biggest health risk of moderate MDMA use)).

While adverse health effects of MDMA shouldn’t be [exaggerated](https://www.thedea.org/mdma-risks-science-and-statistics-technical-faq/mdma-ecstasy-molly-neurotoxicity-brain-damage/), it can cause long-term neurological damage (and thus potentially harm one’s wellbeing or cognitive capacities) if taken in a sub-optimal environment. Please make sure you know what you’re doing [health](https://rollsafe.org/)- and [legality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA#Legal_status)-wise if you ever consider taking MDMA.

(The list below is just a refresher, based on my (potentially faulty) reading of the sources provided and from elsewhere[^animal-testing]. I strongly recommend reading safety guides by [RollSafe.org](https://rollsafe.org/) or [TheDEA](https://www.thedea.org/) if you haven't.)

[^animal-testing]: E.g. I try to avoid linking to studies that do non-human-animal experiments where substitute experiments with consenting humans were possible. (This is a topic for a future post.)

At minimum, **always**:

* [test](https://rollsafe.org/mdma-test-kits/) your “ecstasy” (as what is sold as MDMA or “ecstasy” [often contains other psychoactive compounds](https://rollsafe.org/mdma-test-kits/#why-mdma-should-be-tested) with different safety profiles);
* check for [drug interactions and contraindications](https://www.thedea.org/mdma-ecstasy-molly-users-guide/getting-ready/) (e.g. taking MAOI like tranylcypromine (Parnate) and MDMA even several weeks apart can be [fatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)), avoid a serotonin precursor called 5-HTP before and during the MDMA session, & don’t consume alcohol;
* do not exceed the [normal dose](https://rollsafe.org/how-to-take-mdma/#6-dosage-guideline-your-weight-in-kg-plus-50-total-dosage-in-milligrams-for-the-session);
* [do not overheat & stay hydrated](https://www.thedea.org/mdma-risks-science-and-statistics-technical-faq/mdma-molly-overheating-hyponatremia-how-much-water-to-drink/) (but don’t over do water either);
* do not redose (otherwise you risk a higher chance of neurotoxicity and a worse comedown);
* do not take MDMA while lacking sleep (sleep deprivation may [weaken](https://web.archive.org/web/20220422222603/https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02825-4) the immune system further and may even contribute to an uncomfortable session - i.e. netating the whole reason for taking MDMA that this blog post proposes);
* do not take MDMA more often than once in a few months (definitely save it for the sentience day proposed in this post ;) ), unless you know what you’re doing.

Also consider:

* taking certain [supplements](https://www.thedea.org/mdma-ecstasy-molly-users-guide/mdma-molly-preloading-and-supplements/) before, during, and after the session;
* maintaining a [healthy diet](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/), especially days before and after the session (and don’t eat more than a snack of e.g. berries and nuts before the session if at all, especially if you take MDMA orally; you won’t feel hungry during the session if this is your concern).

Finally, a personal advice if you will: avoid any irreversible decisions while in the MDMA state (or any sufficiently unusual state of consciousness for that matter). This includes interacting with people who aren’t in that state (unless it’s a [therapy](https://maps.org/mdma/) session, obviously), though feel free to record them a message without sending it until at least you’re back to your usual state. For while in the MDMA state, it may be easy to overestimate the actual capacities of one’s post-M self. (This by the way applies the other way around as well: one may underestimate the MDMA experience from one’s un-/less empowered state. Or to generalize: “memory” is state dependent.)

## Summary

Why isn’t the [MDMA](https://www.hedweb.com/ecstasy/index.html) experience a common discussion topic and a shared vision of future wellbeing? In the following text I offer several reasons for the (un)surprising lack of enthusiasm about the MDMA experience. I then put forward an idea that a first-hand MDMA experience could make for a powerful intuition pump for the [abolitionist project](https://www.abolitionist.com/) / [biohappiness revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55jTBJicpbI) and preliminary suggest how we could test that idea. Finally, I share a rather fanciful vision of a day dedicated to raising awareness about the possibility of invincible wellbeing for all sentience.

## Intro

> I feel totally clean and at peace inside. I’m liberated from any unease and can look into people’s eyes not just without tension but out of genuine interest and goodwill. I feel more authentic than ever because I have the inner strength to be so. Time flies by even if I pay attention to each moment, and, alas, there is no “save” button to press.

– anonymous, personal communication

> … alas MDMA itself is not a miracle-cure for damaged minds. Taking MDMA enables the user fleetingly to glimpse something akin to true [mental health](https://www.superhappiness.com/). But with terrible irony, overuse of the drug can [undermine](https://www.mdma.net/longterm/problems.html) what semblance of health its recreational users had to begin with. Darwinian life is extraordinarily [cruel](https://www.abolitionist.com/suffering.html).

– David Pearce, [“Dr Leo Zeff”](https://www.mdma.net/leo-zeff/)

How is it that not everyone is talking about the[^experience-var] [MDMA](https://www.hedweb.com/ecstasy/index.html) experience? Why isn’t the discovery of an insight into potential [post-Darwinian](https://www.hedweb.com/heaven.htm) wellbeing on the news? Where are “The Love and Authenticity of the MDMA Experience and What They Mean for Our Everyday Lives” op-eds? Where are endless blog posts speculating on all sorts of implications of the discovery?

[^experience-var]: Throughout the post I refer to one MDMA state-space of consciousness as “_the_ MDMA experience”, while obviously there is a variation in how people experience MDMA in particular. I.e. for some people, taking MDMA will not induce the MDMA experience I’m referring to in the post (at least not on the first try) because, for example, they have been taking it too frequently or in a sufficiently different [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) (cf. a massive rave vs one’s own room), their biochemistry is different enough from most people, or perhaps they are a clinical psychopath. Unfortunately, this is the next I can do - give a common verbal description of “the” experience of taking (~80–110mg adjusted of pure) MDMA and point to one’s MDMA experience hoping that it matches the one commonly induced by the substance or perhaps other means.

Why aren't the world's health organizations discussing M-like conscious states as a standard of mental health? In particular, where is the WHO’s committing to achieving a sustainable M-like state as per [its own definition of health](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution) (“a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”)? Why don’t scientists, having witnessed such an empowering and loving state of being, collaborate on discovering the precise molecular mechanism of the liberating experience and ways to sustain it? Where are grants and research programs for inventing therapies for securing invincible and socially responsible wellbeing of the M state?

Where are school programs helping young persons safely discover and make the best use of the fleeting M experience? Where are popular songs and art alluding to the “magic” state of being?

Where is a great interest in an M-like wellbeing as an enabler of a compassionate civilization? More fancifully still, where are a common vision of a sustainable future without suffering and a realistic strategy of achieving it?

## A demo of invincible wellbeing

We aren’t surprised to see no such bewilderments, but it may be illustrative to take them at face value. If nothing else, we may be unperplexed for different reasons.

So why are only few people excited about the MDMA experience and view it as a potential standard of future wellbeing? I suggest the following several major factors contributing to this.

First of all, few people have experienced the MDMA state. Which today is a proxy for saying that few people have taken pure MDMA. Which isn’t surprising: MDMA has been illegal since the mid 80s, just before it might have become popular for therapy and recreationally. In many countries it is on the same list as heroin and crystal meth, which have a much higher abuse potential. Prohibitionist propaganda often justifies such indiscriminate grouping by portarting a totally inaccurate picture of MDMA, fueling public phobia about it.

Even those who have tried what they thought was MDMA or, perhaps more commonly, “ecstasy”, have tried a diluted MDMA at best or something else entirely at worst, as the market is unregulated and some sellers (as well as producers) are compelled to cheat. And alas even pure MDMA might not give one the MDMA experience I’m referring to on one’s first try or at all (see the note on variations in “the” experience[^experience-var]).

Second, some people who have tried MDMA are already satisfied with their own lives (or so I’ve been told) so that they don’t dwell much on the experience and are happy to move on with their lives. I would also speculate that some of those lucky people may on some level try to forget the experience, as the contrast with their non-M lives may still be too high. And since they may lack the notion of securing the MDMA experience with better drugs and future genetic engineering, such people may reason that the fleeting “magic” is best to be forgotten.

Third, only a tiny minority of this minority have thought by themselves or encountered the idea of sustainable MDMA analogies and potentially MDMA-like phenotypes. Furthermore, some individuals who have tried MDMA have pre-existing beliefs and notions that make them oppose “re-encephalization” of the human mind even by non-genetic means (e.g. designer drugs).

Likely there are more factors needed to cover the majority of human adults untouched or unconvinced by the MDMA experience (feel free to suggest yours in the [comments](https://gitlab.com/AlexandrNil/less-bad/-/issues/5)!). However, we don’t need to account for the majority of people, for if the idea I pose below holds promise, deeply inspiring even a minority of people [may be enough](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/episode-10.html) to bootstrap the [abolitionist project](https://alexandrnil.gitlab.io/less-bad/posts/thoughts-on-magnus-vindings-reasons-against-prioritising-abolitionist-project/).

<a name=”idea”>The idea is the following:</a>

**The MDMA-like experience may be one of the best currently attainable intuition pumps for the abolitionist project** (at least until humans have empathy great enough to feel suffering of “others” as their own).[^s-pump]

[^s-pump]: The other intuition lever I can think of is perhaps having experienced extreme suffering. For [ethical](https://magnusvinding.com/2018/09/03/the-principle-of-sympathy-for-intense-suffering/) and practical reasons, it should be avoided at any lesser costs.

This is speculative. Yet I think the proposition is worth exploring further, and potentially testing it. For the MDMA experience does indeed, I would say, reveal what might be wrong with one’s Darwinian mind and liberate one from its insecurities and suffering. One thereby can experience such inner peace and capacity for others that the tragedy of the human (etc. if one perhaps thinks [more broadly](https://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/antispeciesist.html)) condition becomes especially clear (at least while the experience lasts - so do take notes if you ever find yourself in the middle of the MDMA experience!). Moreover, as David Pearce [notes](https://www.mdma.net/ecstasy-honesty.html):

> MDMA doesn't just make us honest. E-like consciousness makes us sweeter-natured. Even better, **the idealised self activated by MDMA does not take the form of alien impostor, so to speak, but feels utterly authentic**, constructed from elements of an idealised persona that we can't live up to in drug-naïve life. [bolding mine]

At the same time things look pretty normal (if only brighter and feel softer): there’s no psychedelic headspace, no [visuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/replications/). One can express oneself verbally at least as clearly as one normally can. This apparent normality may make proposing an MDMA-like consciousness as a new normal seem less threatening to those who regard their usual waking consciousness as a fairly [undistorted window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism) onto the objective world,[^realism] as well as to those who believe in a true dichotomy between wireheading and [being happy “about”](https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/11/19/the-tyranny-of-the-intentional-object/) whatever one happens to be hardwired about by genes, etc. The fact that one feels / is able to be much more authentic than in one’s usual life may also help with acceptance from those who believe in a “true self” (although one may insist that one’s “true self” must reside in an “unaltered” consciousness).

[^realism]: Cf. [indirect realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism) and [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism), including Donald Hoffman’s [interface theory of perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Hoffman#The_interface_theory_of_perception) and David Peare’s [non-materialist physicalism](https://www.physicalism.com/).

How confident am I in the proposal (i.e. that not only the MDMA experience would be more effective at making people enthusiastic about the abolitionist project compared to an introduction alone, but it would be one of the most effective intuition pumps for that purpose)? It’s hard to put a number on my confidence/uncertainty, as a lot there depends on implementation of particular interventions (not least since MDMA - the only reliable tool for inducing the MDMA experience - is still an illicit substance; see below). This alone lowers my confidence in a successful utilization of the idea. However, I am “pretty confident” in the basic promise of “the MDMA experience as a demo of future wellbeing”. Evidently, I’m also confident in the idea enough to write a blog post suggesting it as a potential intervention project for further discussion in the community.

What to do with this idea anyway? If others don’t find it _a priori_ absurd (consider holding off your judgment until you have had the MDMA experience ;) though seriously, please do [comment](https://gitlab.com/AlexandrNil/less-bad/-/issues/5)), could we safely test it? As should be clear by now, the conjecture doesn’t seem too unlikely to me. The issue is rather that there appears to be no reliable way of inducing the MDMA experience other than taking the substance. This is potentially problematic, since the mere possession of MDMA is a criminal offense in most countries.

Hence, suggesting MDMA for testing the idea before the substance is decriminalized may seem irresponsible. At the very least one would need to plan for the worst as well (like facing imprisonment).

Still, there is an option of reaching (via e.g. discussion groups or online survey) people who have _already_ tried MDMA and who haven’t heard about the abolitionist project before and compare their responses to those of those who have never tried MDMA (while controlling for things like open mindedness and possibly certain pre-existing beliefs). Ideally though, to test the conjecture, we’d like to also reach those [who would never](https://drugpolicy.org/drug-facts/how-many-people-use-mdma) try pure MDMA, as well as control for things like purity of the substance, dose, environment, etc. (for one thing, clubbing all night on a large (re)dose of “ecstasy”, even if it’s pure MDMA, is probably quite a different experience compared to an MDMA session focused on introspection or discussion in a calm [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting)).

Lest these complications hinder exploration of the conjecture, let’s imagine that MDMA is fully decriminalized. So how could we go about testing the conjecture? I would like to hear your ideas.

My own approach, first of all, would be based on facilitating people’s own (critical) thinking and on fostering mutual respect irrespective of potential disagreements.

Then, for concrete interventions my current best guess is private one-on-one and group discussions with one MDMA experience between communicating the basic idea of the abolitionist project and of invincible wellbeing and a longer discussion (so that e.g. those who aren’t receptive to the ideas don’t quit before having the MDMA experience). A control condition wouldn’t include the MDMA session (though control participants may be offered one after the experiment if they are interested).

To potentially have a higher impact already at the experiment stage, the experiment would target primarily students and professionals who are perhaps a major inspiration away from aligning themselves with the abolitionist project.

## Sentience Liberation Day

If the idea of the MDMA experience as a demo of invincible wellbeing holds any water, then here is an even more outlandish initiative. Any details are TBD, but the core concept is to promote a day dedicated to celebrating a liberation from the Darwinian exploitation of sentience. (Actual wording would be different to make it clear for everyone what the holiday in broad terms is about. It also should go without saying that we want to avoid making any impression of being anti Darwin or anti evolutionary theory!)

The day, in its founding declaration, would encourage people around the world to reflect on the liberating experience of joy and the grim Darwinian reality of being deprived of it (including _feeling_ deprived of it) most of the time. The day would emphasize compassion and active care for all sentience, who are, like oneself, are being trapped in the mind architecture shaped by the indifferent and blind process of gene replication. Most importantly perhaps, the day would also send a message that invincible wellbeing _can_ be secured, and can empower us - as individuals and a deliberate civilization - to actively care and work towards a future where severe suffering is impossible.

The MDMA experience could serve as an example of such future wellbeing. It could also become a tradition to induce an MDMA-like experience on that day (by e.g. consuming MDMA by a standard protocol or a better designer full-spectrum [empathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathogen%E2%80%93entactogen)) and make best use of the temporary liberation (there could be a list of suggested activities like recording a message to one’s “normal” self, reflecting on one’s contribution to the liberation, talking with one’s usual perceived adversaries (when this can be done safely), and learning about plights of the worst-off (in a way that wouldn’t traumatize one after the experience) and of effective ways of alleviating their suffering).

This is just (part of) a rough vision, without any useful hints on how such a day could possibly catch on and be commonly understood in the first place. I’d like to do some research on the feasibility of such a project and potentially pursue the idea further. (Please [contact me](mailto:alexandr.nil.io@gmail.com) if you may be interested in collaborating on evaluating and promoting such a day. See also the ​​[World Day for the End of Speciesism](https://www.end-of-speciesism.org/en/) as an example of a day that may have seemed similarly unreal just a couple of decades ago.)

## Recap

Until we know any better, the MDMA experience may be a direct insight into future wellbeing. By feeling so empowering and healing, it can inspire people to contribute to the abolitionist project. In contrast, exposure to the idea of engineered invincible wellbeing alone can only do so much. And given its prosocial qualities, felt self-authenticity, and lack of psychedelia, the experience may have a potential for a wider appeal as a vision of future health, compared to “narrower” or much more exotic experiences one might imagine as alternatives.

Alas, there is still a lot of stigma and disinformation about the substance that more or less reliably induces the experience. It is also illegal in most countries and can be neurotoxic when taken in big or several doses or while one is overheating, for example. These factors make testing [the idea](#idea) a potential minefield, unless we target only those who have already tried (presumably) pure MDMA in a not too hectic setting.

Lastly, if enough people have had the MDMA experience, the second idea I share in the post mightn’t sound that outlandish. Otherwise, unless one is already a compassionate sentientist, a day where we all reflect on our common “sentienhood”, re-focus on helping the worst-off, utilize the fleeting MDMA experience, and perhaps recommit ourselves towards liberation until next Liberation Day may seem far-fetched.
