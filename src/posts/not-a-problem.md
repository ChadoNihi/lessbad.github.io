## Motivation

During April-June 2021 I participated in a series of online book club meetings dedicated to the first part of Magnus Vinding’s _[Suffering-Focused Ethics: Defense and Implications](https://magnusvinding.com/2020/05/31/suffering-focused-ethics-defense-and-implications/)_ (referenced as “(Vinding, 2020)” in the rest of the post). Most of the participants, aspiring effective altruists (EAs) from Germany, had strong classical utilitarian (CU) leanings or were otherwise sceptical about any fundamental reasons for prioritising reduction of suffering.

This is only my impression - based on the discussions during the meetings as well as one one-on-one - but most of the participants were not unconvinced. One may reasonably suggest that this doesn’t matter in practice, as CUs and negative-leaning consequentialists are aligned in practice and are [reasonably cooperative](https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/why-altruists-should-be-cooperative/) anyway.

This is probably true for most cases today. Still, I think, we should be concerned when some of the most capable and ambitious of ~EAs consider it meaningful and acceptable to “outweigh” even severe suffering by causing “greater” happiness elsewhere (cf. “creating happiness _at the cost of_ suffering” vs “creating happiness _in place of_ suffering” (Vinding, 2020)). The risk is likely insignificant but may be growing by year as EA becomes more [influential](https://80000hours.org/2021/07/effective-altruism-growing/) and more focused on [long-term](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/) [astronomical “value”](https://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html).

Despite such trends, there are many good reasons for focusing on reducing suffering as our collective goal, such as: this aim is endorsed by many traditions and ethical/moral views and may thus serve as a common ground for such views (compare this to agreeing on what things, or even just what kinds of happiness, to be promoted); in general severe suffering is easier to prevent than to create sustainable bliss; suffering is widespread and is more common than “equivalent” happiness; suffering is generally stronger and often chronic; suffering is neglected, and those who suffer usually cannot help themselves; etc. (Vinding, 2020)

But there is one particular line of considerations that alone may account for one’s accepting at least a theoretical case for prioritising alleviating suffering above everything else.

I haven’t seen any counter-arguments to that single consideration that would downplay it for my cause prioritisation. Still, probably only a minority of EAs endorse a suffering-focused theory. And I want to understand why this is the case.

The argument is clearly presented in (Vinding, 2020) and brought up there several times. But I worry that due to the sheer scope of the book, it may be too easy to e.g. move on to some next point without resolving for oneself that one argument (described after the next section). Especially if one is in an adversarial mindset, one may be naturally drawn to easier “targets” in the book (and if one disagrees with a sufficient number of them, one may start to genuinely feel that SFE doesn’t add up).

Hence this brief post: to make the following perspective a bit more visible and to find the ultimate crux of our potential disagreement. (I also realise one already might be sick of the following argument, but then, again, I really want to understand why one doesn’t accept it.)

## What is suffering: a simple definition

To be more on the same page: by “suffering” I mean an overall bad, disagreeable feeling or state of consciousness (borrowing from (Vinding, 2020)). “Bad” does a lot of work here, as it is a reference to a qualia (i.e. “what-it's-likeness”), which like any other qualia - smell of garlic, orange color, thirst, etc. - can only be known by direct experience. (Retrieving it from “memory” would already be only a crude approximation for most readers (I hope).) So if one has never suffered or perhaps is feeling too well to invoke the badness of their past suffering, a verbal description of suffering will not convey, well, suffering.

“Overall” in “overall bad, disagreeable feeling or state of consciousness” should be emphasised too, as

> … one’s experience may contain a component of pain or bittersweet sorrow, but if this component does not render the overall experience negative or disagreeable, then this experience does not constitute suffering on the definition employed here. (Vinding, 2020)


## Not a problem: on severe suffering, missing happiness, and pure absence of happiness

In a nutshell, the argument is that the absence of happiness (or any other experiential state[^non-exp]) is not a problem unless there is someone who _suffers_ the absence (and in that case the suffering/dissatisfaction is what is inherently problematic, not the absence of happiness in itself). Or to put it differently, there’s no need or some kind of universal command[^oblig-source] to go from an empty or otherwise untroubled state to a state of (higher) “value”.

[^oblig-source]: And if there were such a command/obligation/duty, what possible source  behind it and what negative consequences of “disobedience” would be?

[^non-exp]: In this post I focus mostly on experiential “values”. But since pursuing putative non-experiential sources of intrinsic “value” can come at the cost of not preventing unnecessary suffering, the problematicity of suffering I refer to in the text is still of direct relevance, I think.

Whereas suffering is inherently problematic - its [defining](#what-is-suffering%3A-a-simple-definition) badness is inherent to the experience itself - and, in the case of severe suffering, utterly urgent. Other things by themselves don’t have any urgency for actualising them. So they can wait.

When talking about the inherit or self-revealing “badness” or “disvalue” of suffering, an intuitive reply often is that happiness, in the analogous way, is self-intimatingly “good” or of “value”.

One answer is simply, however wonderful sublime happiness is, this doesn’t change the fact that it requires an external observer - a frustrated one, more specifically - to make the absence problematic. And even in that case the source of any identifiable problem would still be a disagreeable experience - in this case the frustration of the observer. Suffering, in contrast, is problematic in itself.[^happiness-absence]

[^happiness-absence]: I’m pretty much repeating what Vinding wrote:

	> … no matter how intense happiness can be, it does not change the fact that there is no moral urgency found in the neutral absence of happiness, or in mild happiness that could be more intense. Nor does it change the fact that the presence of intense suffering is felt as intrinsically problematic, as experienced from the inside, whereas the notion that the absence of intense happiness carries a similarly problematic nature must be imposed from the outside — it is not intrinsic to the mere absence of happiness. (Vinding, 2020)

I also think it is important to distinguish the [phenomenal character](https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/blog/rigorous-reports) of an experience from its semantic or “intentional” (i.e. “what-it-is-about”) content. Otherwise, we risk talking past each other from these different levels. For one can see certain ideas and objects in the world as being of intrinsic value, but one can argue that it is the phenomenal character of one’s consciousness about these ideas what ethically matters, not the semantic content of one’s ideas.

Moving on:

One may propose that since in some cases one can make one’s suffering more bearable with some mental techniques, suffering isn’t inherently bad.

My reply would be that by making one’s suffering more bearable one simply enters more bearable suffering. That’s it. And just as one would use medication to reduce one’s pain, one could use some mental techniques like rationalisations to try to achieve less aversive suffering.

Specifically to mental tactics we could also note that even if most humans could tone down even their severe suffering through mental techniques, these techniques wouldn’t be available to humans and other sentient beings who lack necessary cognitive capacities. (This is, by the way, one critical flaw I see in (my extremely limited model of) Buddhism, namely that, while being focused on alleviating suffering, its techniques and worldview are only available to (a subset of) humans. Perhaps it’s time for Buddhism to embrace [biotechnology](https://www.gene-drives.com/)?)

Finally, it may be tempting (after a long unresolved discussion, for example) to think that there is a “value difference” between “value” maximisers and suffering-focused “problem solvers”. And so, the thinking goes, there’s no need for “value” maximisers to explain the alleged inherent need to “improve” beyond any untroubled state. They can just axiomatically declare that this is a “good” thing to do, potentially even preferable to preventing severe suffering, other things being equal, if the “value” in question is big enough.

This seems unsatisfactory to me: even assuming for a moment that the (intrinsic) “value difference” is real, a question we may need to ask ourselves is: As truth-seeking agents (I assume), should we axiomatically assert a principle - let alone one guiding our ethics - that has a crucial unresolved question posed to it? Specifically, until I find a sensible case for an intrinsic “value” of creating some purported good (and for the implied universal imperative of pursuing that “value”), the “value difference” card will seem to me more like a copout (deliberate or not).

## A brief note on “value”

When discussing ethics in any precise way, I try (to my best) to avoid the word “value”. The reason is that the concept, I think, already is too high-level and assumes too much. To that later point, most of us probably share the intuition that something of intrinsic “value” is preferable to vacuum (valueless one, if you will) and ideally should be maximised. All sorts of models are then built around this intuition.

The notion of value may also suggest that “disvalue”, no matter how big, can in some ethically-meaningful sense be cancelled out or outweighed by “value” elsewhere. While this makes sense as an abstract, mathematical exercise, when applied to the real world, this model can grossly mislead us: for example, if we equate “value” with wellbeing without adjusting for the physical realities of this phenomenon, the model tells us that instead of reducing suffering itself, we can [“outweigh”](https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/on-purported-positive-goods-outweighing-suffering/) it by happiness elsewhere (or even by the notional “total wellbeing” aggregated across disconnected individuals).[^concerns-cu]

[^concerns-cu]: Susceptibility to such IMO naive modeling is one of my major [concerns with CU](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MhsJgYRarrtGdTv8S/some-concerns-with-classical-utilitarianism), by the way.

One way to mitigate these concerns is to talk instead about concrete things or phenomena that one thinks are intrinsically worth preventing, preserving, or maximising - _and_ how and in what sense not doing so would be a problem.

Even “just” adopting a more functional word, e.g. “priority”, would add significantly to clarity and help to avoid the [teleological](https://scholar.princeton.edu/jfrick/publications/conditional-reasons-and-procreation-asymmetry) intuitions behind the word “value”. Although I would still strongly suggest to be closer to the metal, so to speak, by referring to concrete things of one’s whats and whys of ethics.

Such “devaluation” of ethics, I suggest, adds greater clarity to it. And it is clarity, not obscurity, that will lead us to a better understanding of ethics.[^decision-converge]

[^decision-converge]: With regards to understanding ethics, I find the idea that ethics and decision-theoretic rationality may ultimately converge the most plausible. David Pearce is one person who [seems](https://www.hedweb.com/quora/2015.html) to hold such a view (search there for “decision”).


## Conclusion

What I wanted to draw one’s attention with this post is the idea that absence of anything isn’t inherently problematic, while suffering is.

Going any further than this - e.g. exploring implications or emphasising that even strongly suffering-focused views have good reasons for pursuing purported intrinsic goods like [happiness](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/t3St6Fz4DmHtKfgqm/positive-roles-of-life-and-experience-in-suffering-focused)[^indirect] and knowledge -  is beyond the scope of the post (not least since those out-of-scope topics have been covered elsewhere, including (Vinding, 2020)).

[^indirect]: See also Pearce’s [“indirect negative utilitarianism”](https://www.utilitarianism.com/pinprick-argument.html).

And getting clarity on the subject matter may be crucial since knowing what is - and isn’t - a real problem would affect our prioritisation, including potentially reverberations for the distant future. With this one obscure blog post though I don’t aim any higher than simply seeking to understand those who consider a mere absence of something in itself problematic. So please do comment or send me an email if you have any relevant points or pointers. Thank you!
